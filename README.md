# Advent of Code 2022, Ruby


## Usage

Install dependencies
`bundle install`

**Puzzle 1, Part 1:**

Run `./bin/puzzle1part1 path_to_your_input_file`

example:
```
➜ ./bin/puzzle1part1 puzzle1input.txt
12345
```

**Puzzle1, Part 2:**

Run the same as Part 1 with additional -n argument set to 3, for top 3 bags to sum
example:
```
➜ ./bin/puzzle1part1 -n 3 puzzle1input.txt
12345
```

## Development

I used gem boilerplate for development, because I'm lazy.
